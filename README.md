This is a new [**React Native**](https://reactnative.dev) project, bootstrapped using [`@react-native-community/cli`](https://github.com/react-native-community/cli).

# Notes by client and group

> **Note**: Was built with node 18 and ruby 3.1.4

## install/run

```bash
# using npm
npm install

# for IOS install
cd ios && pod install

# run ios
npm run ios

# run android
npm run android
```

## Task

- Create a simple note-taking app in roughly 2 hours ✅
- Users should be able to create different notes and link them to a client and a category. ✅
- The client and category data should be stored in a JSON file. ✅
- The main page of the app should display a FlatList of all existing notes or show a message if there are none. ✅
- The available categories to choose from are "Goal Evidence," "Support Coordination," and "Active Duty." ✅
- The app should have a button to add new notes. When adding a new note, the user should be able to select a client, choose a category, and enter the note text. ✅
- All notes should be stored in local memory and persisted so that they are not lost when the user closes and reopens the app. ✅
- Users should be able to edit and delete notes as needed. ✅

## Bonus

- Dark and light theme version

## Todo (tried to keep to the 2 hours)

- Should have delete function on both edit and list screens
- Should have some simple filtering
- Splash screen
- App icon
